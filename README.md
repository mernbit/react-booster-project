# Note from developer

- When you run the frontend, It will give you two URLs. one will look like http://localhost:5173 and the other will look like http://THE_IP_ADDRESS_IT_PROVIDES:5173/.
- Copy the second URL and change the PORT to your server's PORT.
- Put the URL in the .env file as VITE_API_URL.
- If you use http://localhost:PORT, it'll only work in your machine. if you use http://THE_IP_ADDRESS_IT_PROVIDES:PORT, it'll work in your machine and other machines in your local network.
- Now, do npm run dev in the server folder and npm run dev in the client folder.
- Ready to use
